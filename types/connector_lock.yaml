      Errors for Connector Lock

      These following error types give more details about connector lock errors.
      You should consider setting a MREC_1_ConnectorLockFailure to indicated a generic lock failure with an MREC error code as well
      as one of the more detailed but custom error codes to specify the reason:

      ConnectorLockCapNotCharged: The capacitor for connector lock motor failed to charge within expected time
      ConnectorLockUnexpectedOpen: The connector lock feedback does return open while it should be close
      ConnectorLockUnexpectedClose: The connector lock feedback does return closed while it should be open
      ConnectorLockFailedLock: The connector lock failed to lock (feedback still returns open)
      ConnectorLockFailedUnlock: The connector lock failed to unlock (feedback still returns closed)

      All error codes that begin with MREC needs to be implemented to fulfill the Minimum Required Error Codes defined by the ChargeX consortium:

      https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2023/07/ChargeX_MREC_Rev5_09.12.23.pdf

      MREC_1_ConnectorLockFailure: Failure to lock or unlock connector on the vehicle side. 
            How should that be implemented? We can only find out about locking on the EVSE side,
            so we will use this error to report EVSE side lock failures.
